# CHESS
Simple chess engine in C++. All AI promotions are queen (the move input system is not sophisticated enough right now sorry) and the 50 move rule is not implemented (however the move counter is implemented). If there are any bugs please send in an issue or message me on Discord (normalexisting).

- Also includes a version for an ESP32 and some LED panels.
